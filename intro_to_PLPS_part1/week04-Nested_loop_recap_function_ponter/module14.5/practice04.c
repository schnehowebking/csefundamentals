// Question: Make a function named small_to_capital() which will take a small alphabet as a parameter (which is a character) and it will convert that small alphabet to capital alphabet and return through that function. So, the return type will be char. Now in the main function take a character input which will be small alphabets and call that function to get the capital alphabet and print that in the main function.

// Bonus: You can also try this with 4 different types of function use cases.
